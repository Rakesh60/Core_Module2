        </b></p>

        <font color="blue">security</font>, cyber<font color="blue">security</font> (cyber <font color="blue">security
        </font>), or information technology security (IT <font color="blue">security</font>) is the
        protection of <font color="lime">Computer</font> systems and networks from attack by malicious actors that may
        result in unauthorized
        information disclosure, theft of, or damage to hardware, software, or data, as well as from the disruption or
        misdirection of the services they provide.

    <p>Cyber <font color="blue">Security</font> is the practice of identifying the vulnerabilities and threats Cyber
        <font color="blue">Security</font> is important because the <u><b>government</b></u>, military, law enforcement,
        and private
        industry use many
        critical resources that could be negatively affected by cyber attacks. Many of these systems are financial, such
        as banks, credit cards, ATMs, stock markets and networks. <u><b>Government</b></u> agencies use software to
        manage the
        US
        budget system and the military uses software to track troop movement. Because of these vital uses, cyber attacks
        could cripple important services or even destroy the countrys financial <font color="blue">Security</font>.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        A major concern to cyber <font color="blue">Security</font> is providing more efficient support to better
        protect against cyber related
        activities. This means an organization must have the information available to help identify possible threats
        including understanding what possible methods <font color="red"><b><u><i>hackers</i></u></b></font> may use to
        gain access, and how the organization can
        prepare for any potential attacks.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p><i>The number of <font color="red"><b><u><i>hackers</i></u></b></font> in the world has increased, and so has
            their level of sophistication. When even
            <b>Deloitte</b>, the largest cyber<font color="blue">security</font> consultant company in the world was not
            able to protect itself from a
            <font color="orange">cyber-attack</font>, think of how easy it would be for a <font color="red">
                <b><u><i>hacker</i></u></b>
            </font> to enter your cell phones. The easy availability of
            <font color="red"><b><u><i>hacking</i></u></b></font> tools on the internet has made cyber attacks an even
            stronger possibility. These tools are getting
            more updated and superior day by day, and so are the people using them.
